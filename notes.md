Hello I am Stephen Okita here to present the technical

Our solution is split into 5 parts

1. Hardware

- We are using a multiple spectrometers in order to for fast data collection

2. Network

- This is connected to a raspberry pi running an api which will communicate the data back to earth

3. Database

- The data is proceed using github actions and put into a IPFS database

4. Formatting

- The data is then formate into graphs and clear metadata and posted to our website

5. Statistics

- We will do additional anal useful for researchers on the topic include but not limited to trends and heatmaps. This will also be published to our website.

As this is all decentrely hosted the cost will simply be for hardware.
