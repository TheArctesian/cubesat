# Cubesat 
Kinda rushed but have an adruino module to get spect data some more py scripts to get it out and ten a simple flask rest server to network with earth. Lastley Nic put it some jupyter which will run on ground for cleaning data.


To do this we are using a 
- Arduino and ras pi
- Gyroscope to keep in the place 
- Spectrometer 
    - Send infread ray back to earth 
    - Manipulate wavelength values and parse into gas specfic 
    - Record Location data
- Open source flask api 
- Detection algo auto updates our website using github action 
- Using IPFS to host and add data so low cost 
- Donation based model
